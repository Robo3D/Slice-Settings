# Cura 3 slicing profiles (DEV)

To upload Quality, Material, and Definition files for testing, open your Cura 3 application folder 
and find the `Resources\resources` folder.  From here you should see subfolders for Quality, Materials, and Definitions.
Simply copy the appropriate files into these folders and restart Cura.  All the settings should be available on startup.
